# Decision Log

Last verified: 2026-07-13
Update triggers: append when an architectural/policy/business decision is made or reversed.

An ADR-style ("Architecture Decision Record") running log so future agents don't re-litigate
settled calls. Newest first. Each entry is a decision, why it was made, and the operative
rule it implies. This is a log of outcomes, not a design doc — see the cited source for detail.

## 2026-07-12/13 — Backup strategy: weekly off-site + weekly in-DB snapshot

**Decision:** Two independent weekly backups run: an encrypted `pg_dump` pushed to the private
GitHub repo `masonwells1/CRX_Backups` (GitHub Action), and a same-database `pg_cron` snapshot
into a `backup_snapshots` table (migration `20260713050000`), pruned only on full success.
**Why:** Supabase's org plan is FREE, which has no PITR (point-in-time recovery) — these two
jobs are the only recovery path if data is lost or corrupted.
**What this forbids/implies:** don't assume PITR exists. Don't prune/trim `backup_snapshots`
on a partial run. Treat the off-site copy as the disaster-recovery copy (same-DB snapshot
doesn't survive a DB-level disaster).

## 2026-07-10 — Live migration apply is hands-free, gated by the apply-guard proof

**Decision:** Applying a live migration no longer needs an in-chat approval popup, but it is
still hard-gated: an agent may only call `apply_migration` after producing a fresh
migration-apply-guard proof file (this session's reviewer verdict), and SQL/RLS/money/edge-fn
changes require an actual Codex review verdict this session first.
**Why:** Mason wants momentum on reversible work without a popup for every migration, but a
live-DB apply is irreversible enough to need a real, current, adversarial second look — not a
rubber-stamp.
**What this forbids/implies:** never apply a live migration on a stale or "prior session"
verdict; the proof file must be generated in the current session. In an ordinary interactive
session, still get Mason's in-chat OK (or point to a mission/loop document where he explicitly
pre-authorized applies for that run) — the proof gate is a floor, not a substitute for his
authorization. (Note 2026-07-13: repo prose and session reminders disagree on whether the
proof gate alone suffices; flagged for Mason to settle — until then, take the stricter reading.)

## ~2026-07-10 — Business time is America/Chicago; the live DB and pg_cron run UTC

**Decision:** All business-day logic (billing dates, "today" dashboards, cron schedules) must
convert explicitly from UTC to America/Chicago; never treat the database clock as local time.
**Why:** this bit twice on 2026-07-10 — date boundaries computed off the DB's UTC clock put
late-evening activity on the wrong business day. (Source: session memory — the fix pattern is
visible in the workflow-waves cron migrations; verify before relying.)
**What this forbids/implies:** any new query, RPC, or cron job that groups or filters by
business date must apply the timezone conversion explicitly; a bare `now()::date` on the live
DB is a bug.

---

## 2026-07-05 / 2026-07-11 — Migration/SQL/deploy permission prompts removed; hooks are the gate

**Decision:** In-chat approval popups for migrations, SQL execution, and edge-function deploys
were removed (commit `97f7bf94`, 2026-07-05) and the removal was reinforced (commit `9e3e8f10`,
2026-07-11) after tracked `settings.json` kept resurrecting the prompts in fresh worktrees.
**Why:** HARD guards (hooks that actually block) are more reliable safety than a SOFT prose
rule or a popup an agent can talk past — see AGENTS.md's HARD-vs-SOFT principle.
**What this forbids/implies:** don't re-add approval popups for these actions; if a fresh
worktree shows prompts again, that's the known `settings.json` gotcha, not a policy reversal —
fix the hook/settings file instead.

---

## ~2026-06-30 — New SECURITY DEFINER functions must explicitly revoke anon

**Decision:** Every new `SECURITY DEFINER` function must `REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM PUBLIC` and
then explicitly `REVOKE ... FROM anon` — `REVOKE FROM PUBLIC` alone does not de-anonymize a
function that was separately granted to `anon`.
**Why:** repeated bug-hunt cycles (e.g. migration `20260713040000_revoke_anon_trigger_fn_exec`,
migration `20260616122108_revoke_execute_order_shares_guard_fn`) found SECDEF functions still
callable by the anonymous role after only a PUBLIC revoke.
**What this forbids/implies:** a migration that adds a SECDEF function and revokes only
PUBLIC is incomplete; always add the explicit anon revoke in the same migration.

---

## ~2026-06-28 — Internal-only product direction: no grower portal yet

**Decision:** CRX Manager's near-term roadmap targets internal/office users only; "beyond
parity" features (Office Cockpit, etc.) are built for staff, not growers.
**Why:** owner call — a grower-facing portal is a bigger investment than the current business
need justifies.
**What this forbids/implies:** don't design new features assuming grower login/self-service;
that's a future, separate decision. (Source: session memory — verify with Mason before relying
if this becomes load-bearing for a new feature.)

---

## 2026-06-23 — Two-acre model: full boundary acres vs. edited billable acres

**Decision:** Fields carry two acre figures — `measured_acres` (from the mapped boundary) and
an editable `override_acres`; per-acre billing always uses the edited/override figure via
`COALESCE(override_acres, measured_acres, total_acres)`.
**Why:** a GPS/satellite boundary's raw acreage often doesn't match what the grower is billed
for (buffers, waterways, etc.), so billing needs a human-correctable number distinct from the
mapped one.
**What this forbids/implies:** never bill off the raw boundary acreage directly; always read
the billable figure through the override-first COALESCE, and any new acre-consuming feature
must respect the same precedence (verified: migration `20260623120000`).

---

## 2026-06-17 — Split invoices modeled order-side, allocated by field/acre

**Decision:** Multi-customer billing splits live on the order side (`order_shares` /
`invoice_shares`), allocated by field/acre rather than by dollar percentage alone.
**Why:** the real-world unit of split billing on a farm job is the field each customer's acres
were treated on, not an arbitrary percentage.
**What this forbids/implies:** `order_shares`/`invoice_shares` are the split-billing surface;
don't reach for one of the other dormant split tables (`order_item_field_allocations`,
`field_app_location_shares`, `job_field_shares`) for new split-billing work without checking
which one is actually live for that flow first (verified: docs/CHANGELOG.md 2026-06-17 entry).

---

## 2026-06-16 — Auto-push to `main` authorized for green, reversible code

**Decision:** Once a code change (not a migration) passes the full gate — lint, typecheck,
build, tests, Codex review — an agent may push it to `main` without a further in-chat OK.
Vercel's one-click rollback is the safety net.
**Why:** Mason wants momentum on ordinary reversible work; a frontend push to a Vercel-hosted
app is trivially undoable, unlike a live migration or data mutation.
**What this forbids/implies:** this authorization is code/frontend only. Live migration apply,
edge-function deploy, deleting data, and force-push remain hard-gated behind explicit
in-conversation approval every time (verified: referenced as "Mason 2026-06-16" across
docs/loops/*, docs/build-loops/*).

---

## 2026-06-14 — Prepay "earmark" engine SHELVED pending a reserved-pool redesign

**Decision:** The booking-prepay earmark engine (3 migrations: `20260613240000`,
`20260613250000`, `20260613280000`) and its frontend controls were pulled from the go-live
batch and parked in `docs/roadmap/shelved-earmark-engine/`.
**Why:** Codex review found it could double-spend and misreport funds because it trusted
per-credit balances while a second legacy code path (`apply_remaining_prepayments`) spent the
same money from an aggregate balance with no shared guard — a real money-integrity bug, not a
style nit.
**What this forbids/implies:** do not re-apply the 3 parked migrations or re-add the earmark
UI as-is. Any revival needs the reserved-pool redesign described in that README (a dedicated
reserved balance, not a patch) plus a fresh Codex-gated build.

---

## Foundational (~2026-05, still current) — Core engineering invariants

**Decision:** Four rules fixed at the project's foundation and never revisited: (1) money is
always `bigint` cents, never floating-point; (2) business invariants (balances, inventory,
state transitions) are enforced in Postgres RPCs/triggers/constraints, not React; (3)
`src/lib/db.ts` is the only Supabase client, and `assertRpcResult()`/`checkMutationResult()`
are mandatory after every RPC call/`.update()`/`.delete()`; (4) every mutating RPC accepts and
actually enforces `p_idempotency_key text DEFAULT NULL` (added after repeated double-submit
bugs, e.g. the 2026-07-10 `save_job_applied_record` fix).
**Why:** these are the recurring bug classes (money bugs, invariant bypass via a second code
path, double-submits from retries/flaky networks) that have cost the most rework historically.
**What this forbids/implies:** any new RPC, migration, or money-touching code that violates
one of these four is a defect, not a style choice — these are enforced in AGENTS.md as CRX
Hard Rules, not just convention.

---

## Foundational (still current) — Docs & tooling: AGENTS.md is canonical, HARD over SOFT

**Decision:** `AGENTS.md` is the one hand-maintained, cross-agent contract; `.agents/` and
`.codex/hooks.json` are generated adapters (via `scripts/sync-agent-workflows.mjs`) and must
never carry an independent copy of workflow logic. Separately, whenever a safety rule matters,
it should be encoded as a hook/test/type-check (HARD, actually blocks bad output) rather than
added as another line of prose (SOFT, just advises and dilutes over time).
**Why:** two competing hand-written rule sets drift out of sync silently; prose rules pile up
and get skimmed past, while a hook can't be forgotten.
**What this forbids/implies:** never hand-edit `.agents/` or `.codex/hooks.json` directly to
add logic — edit the source under `.claude/` and regenerate. When tempted to add a new prose
rule for something that really matters, prefer writing a hook/check instead.

## How to add an entry

Append a new entry at the **top** of the decision list (right after this file's header, before
the newest existing entry) whenever Mason makes an irreversible, architectural, or
business-policy call — not for routine bug fixes or ordinary feature work. Use the format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <decision title>

**Decision:** one sentence — what was decided.
**Why:** plain English — the reasoning, in terms a non-coder owner would recognize.
**What this forbids/implies:** the operative rule an agent must follow because of this decision.
```

Keep each entry under ~8 lines total. **Never rewrite or delete a past entry** — if a decision
is later reversed or superseded, add a **new** entry describing the reversal, and reference the
old entry by its date/title (e.g. "Supersedes 2026-06-14 — Prepay earmark engine SHELVED").
Update the "Last verified" date at the top whenever you review this file, even if you add
nothing.
