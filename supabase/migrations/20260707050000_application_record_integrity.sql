-- sql-safety: exempt-registry — this migration's own ALTER TABLE (below) ADDs
--   application_records.applicator_name + applicator_license_number, and the
--   complete_job INSERT then writes them in the SAME file. The schema-registry
--   won't list those columns until a post-apply /regen-schema-registry, so the
--   registry-backed column-existence check flags them as a false positive. No
--   catalog-definition-cloning function is used anywhere here — both function
--   bodies are written out in full and the verification DO block reads prosrc.
-- N2-7 / U10-remainder — application-record legal integrity (findings #106 + #109).
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Three surgical, ADDITIVE corrections to the job -> application-record -> invoice
-- chain. Every function body below is the byte-exact LIVE catalog definition
-- (fetched from the live catalog against rhyzpcqhnizqbxphqdkr, 2026-07-06 — saved
-- to .claude/session-state/live-defs/u10-*.sql) re-emitted with ONLY the marked deltas.
--
--   #106a — application_records.application_date must be the ACTUAL application date.
--           Today complete_job stamps v_job.job_date (the planned date). Change it to
--           the date of the actual start time (job_applied_info.actual_start_time, which
--           start_job stamped, or the p_applied_info->>'actual_start_time' the completer
--           just sent), falling back to v_job.job_date exactly as today when no actual
--           start exists. (The job_applied_info upsert a few lines above already merged
--           both sources, so reading that row is the single source of truth.)
--
--   #106b — application_records is a legal spray record; profiles rows mutate over time.
--           Snapshot the applicator's NAME + LICENSE NUMBER as-of completion so the
--           record stays accurate even if the applicator's profile later changes or is
--           deactivated. Two new nullable columns; complete_job fills them from profiles
--           for the SAME applicator it already attributes the record to
--           (CASE WHEN is_applicator() THEN v_actor ELSE v_job.applicator_id END).
--
--   #109  — job-born invoices must carry the JOB's season, not the season-of-now.
--           transfer_job_to_invoice today stamps invoices.season from a CASE on
--           CURRENT_DATE; an invoice cut in a later season for a prior-season job would
--           file under the wrong season. Stamp v_job.season instead — with a COALESCE
--           fallback to the old CURRENT_DATE expression because invoices.season is
--           NOT NULL and jobs.season is nullable (never stamp NULL). CONFIRMED at
--           implementation (the live INSERT does use the now()-based CASE).
--
-- Scope notes:
--   * complete_job's base = the B2 block of 20260707011000_start_complete_job_null_actor_guard
--     (applied ~2026-07-07); re-fetched live and diff-confirmed byte-identical before
--     re-emit. transfer_job_to_invoice base = current live def. Both single-overload.
--   * The ONLY other writer of application_records is the blend-ticket path
--     (create_application_record_from_blend_ticket, source_type='blend_ticket') — it is
--     out of scope for the new snapshot columns (blend records carry their own applicator
--     provenance) and is unaffected: it lists explicit columns, so two new NULLABLE columns
--     it omits default to NULL, breaking nothing.
--   * Additive only: new columns are nullable with no default; no CHECK/enum change; no
--     column rename; SET search_path preserved; ACLs re-asserted byte-identical to live.
