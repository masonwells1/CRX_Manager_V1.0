-- OVERNIGHT BUG HUNT — TWO transfer_job_to_invoice fixes folded into one CREATE OR REPLACE
-- (the function is reproduced verbatim once; folding avoids a second 180-line repro):
--   • Run 1 cycle 1 finding #3 (this file's original): the missing financial_audit_log
--     'invoice_created' row.  dedupeKey: audit-log:transfer_job_to_invoice:missing-invoice-created-row
--     Severity MEDIUM (verifier, dormant job->billing path) / HIGH (Codex). Both recorded.
--   • Run 2 cycle 2 finding #3: invoice_shares penny-drift on percentage splits — the header→shares
--     reconcile was override-only, so split shares could sum ±1c off the header.
--     dedupeKey: money:transfer_job_to_invoice:invoice-shares-penny-drift. MEDIUM (verifier) / HIGH (Codex).
--     Fix marked inline below ("OVERNIGHT FIX (Run 2 cycle 2, finding #3 — penny-drift)").
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG
-- transfer_job_to_invoice is the ONLY invoice-creating RPC that never writes the canonical
-- financial_audit_log 'invoice_created' row (it only writes activity_feed 'job_invoiced').
-- The other six creators (create_invoice_from_order, create_invoice_from_blend_ticket,
-- create_invoice_for_unbilled_delivery, save_field_app_invoice, create_split_invoices_from_order)
-- all write it. The invoice is created draft->unposted (never posted), so post_invoice's later
-- 'invoice_posted' row never supplies creation provenance. Result: every invoice born from a
-- completed spray job has no creation entry in the append-only money ledger.
--
-- THE FIX
-- Add the same canonical 'invoice_created' financial_audit_log INSERT the sibling creators use,
-- after the header total is finalized (the per-acre fee in DELTA-8 can still adjust it, so the
-- audit row reads the FINAL invoices.total_amount_cents back from the row). Nothing else changes
-- — this is the live transfer_job_to_invoice body reproduced verbatim, plus one INSERT (marked
-- "OVERNIGHT FIX (finding #3)"). A rolled-back line-level diff vs the live body confirms the
-- ONLY added executable statement is that INSERT.
--
-- ROLLBACK: re-apply the prior definition (remove the marked OVERNIGHT FIX block).
