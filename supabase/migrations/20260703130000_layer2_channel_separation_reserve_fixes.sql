-- Layer 2 · Part A polish · Cycle A3.12 — two-sell-channel separation (push-gate #A/#C)
-- (owner clarification 2026-07-03: chemical sales [we DELIVER] and job applications
--  [we APPLY] are SEPARATE demands on the shed — they ADD UP, never offset)
-- ============================================================================
-- Owner model (Mason, 2026-07-03): the business runs two sell channels off the same
-- planned booking — (1) CHEMICAL SALES: product we deliver to the customer for them
-- to apply (order draws → delivery), and (2) JOB APPLICATIONS: product WE apply for
-- the customer (job draws → application invoice). Both hold shed stock until fulfilled,
-- for DIFFERENT reasons, so their inventory reservations must ADD UP and never cancel
-- each other. Mason needs an accurate "what's scheduled for us to apply" (shed) count.
--
-- Two fixes from the full-feature Codex push-gate (2026-07-03):
--   #A  `_sync_quote_job_reservations` sized a job hold as demand MINUS the order's
--       drawn quantity (assuming the two channels shared stock). Under the separate-
--       channel model that UNDER-counts the shed requirement (delivered order stock is
--       gone / earmarked for the customer, not for us to apply). FIX: a job hold =
--       its FULL application demand. The drawn portion still shrinks the crop hold
--       (net-zero WITHIN the booking, no double-count); demand beyond the drawable
--       booking is genuinely extra shed need. Supersedes the round-2/3 order-prebooked-
--       overlap subtraction. (Draws are unchanged — order+job draws still cap at the
--       booking, so nothing is double-BILLED; only the shed RESERVATION changes.)
--   #C  `restore_quote_version` rebuilt only the quote-side crop holds, leaving active
--       jobs' draws/holds stale after a restore. FIX: it now re-syncs the quote's jobs
--       via the coordinated allocator, exactly as save_quote does.
--
-- DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED HERE — push-gate #B (a booking fully consumed by COMPLETED
-- jobs can't be "accepted"): in this app "accept" == Convert-to-Order == create a
-- CHEMICAL SALE. Converting an APPLICATION-fulfilled booking into a chemical-sale order
-- is the wrong channel (owner model above). Such a booking safely stays sent/revised and
-- is fulfilled via the job/application invoices; a dedicated "close / mark fulfilled by
-- application" lifecycle is an owner business-process decision, not a guard relaxation.
-- (Codex A3.12 P2 confirmed the DB relaxation was unreachable AND semantically wrong.)
--
-- #C is reproduced VERBATIM from its live catalog definition (introspected + diffed);
-- the ONLY change is the marked LAYER2-CHAN line. Warn-only; dormant on the current
-- empty operational DB (0 job draws/holds).
--
-- status-enum-check: exempt (writes the 'job' hold_type superset added by A1 20260702170000)
