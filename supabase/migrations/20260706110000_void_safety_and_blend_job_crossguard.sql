-- U6 — void safety (#65) + blend<->job double-bill cross-guards (#91)
-- REBASED 2026-07-06 (originally drafted as 20260706050000): transfer_job_to_invoice
-- has since been re-emitted LIVE by U4 (customer_supplied $0 lines + price_source
-- pin, marked with -- U4<<< / >>>U4 below). This file's transfer_job_to_invoice
-- body is the CURRENT LIVE text with ONLY the #91b BLEND_TICKET_ALREADY_BILLED
-- guard re-applied on top (verbatim from the original draft) — the U4 changes are
-- carried forward untouched. void_invoice and create_invoice_from_blend_ticket
-- were diffed against live and found UNCHANGED since the original draft was
-- written, so their bodies are unchanged from the draft.
-- =============================================================================
-- READ-ONLY-BASED, ADDITIVE re-emits of three LIVE functions. Each body below is
-- byte-for-byte the current live function definition (verified by reading the
-- live source directly) EXCEPT the clearly marked "-- U6 ..." additions (and, for
-- transfer_job_to_invoice, the pre-existing "-- U4<<< ... >>>U4" additions already
-- live). No existing line was altered or removed beyond that.
--
-- #65 void_invoice: when a field_application invoice that a job was transferred
--     into is voided (or draft/unposted-cancelled), release the job back to
--     'completed' and clear jobs.invoice_id so it is no longer stranded in the
--     terminal 'invoiced' state pointing at a dead invoice. The invoiced->completed
--     edge is FORWARD-ONLY in _enforce_job_status_transition; we use the SAME
--     sanctioned mechanism transfer_invoice_to_job uses — the transaction-scoped
--     admin-override GUC (SET LOCAL app.admin_override='true' ... RESET) bracketed
--     tightly around the single jobs UPDATE. (We deliberately do NOT add an
--     invoiced->completed edge to the enforcer, which would let ANY caller flip it.)
--
-- #91a create_invoice_from_blend_ticket: block (JOB_ALREADY_INVOICED) when the
--     ticket's job has already been invoiced — otherwise the same application is
--     billed twice (once via the job invoice, once via the blend ticket).
--
-- #91b transfer_job_to_invoice: block (BLEND_TICKET_ALREADY_BILLED) when a blend
--     ticket for this job is already 'billed' (a live invoice exists) — same
--     double-bill, other direction.
--
-- RpcErrorCodes: this migration introduces two new caller-facing exception codes
-- that the frontend RpcErrorCodes map (src/lib/db.ts) needs to recognize —
-- JOB_ALREADY_INVOICED (create_invoice_from_blend_ticket) and
-- BLEND_TICKET_ALREADY_BILLED (transfer_job_to_invoice) — so hasRpcCode() checks
-- at the callsites can show a friendly message instead of a raw Postgres error.
--
-- Overloads: each of the three functions has exactly ONE overload live (verified);
-- CREATE OR REPLACE with the identical signature keeps it that way. A verification
-- DO block at the end asserts no accidental second overload was introduced.
-- =============================================================================

-- #65  void_invoice
-- Surgical changes vs live:
--   1. DECLARE: added `  v_job record;`
--   2. draft/unposted -> cancelled branch: added the "-- U6 #65 job-release" block
--      right after the `UPDATE invoices SET status='cancelled' ...` statement.
--   3. posted/overdue -> voided branch: added the same "-- U6 #65 job-release"
--      block right after the `UPDATE invoices SET status='voided' ...` statement.
-- Everything else is byte-identical to the live source (confirmed unchanged since
