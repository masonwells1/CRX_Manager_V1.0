-- 20260707080000_u7_spray_job_split_path.sql
-- U7 SAFE-SCOPE (findings #42 / #100 / #50) — spray-job half of splits unification.
--
-- We are NOT re-architecting transfer_job_to_invoice into per-owner groups (that would
-- reopen the 5 U8 commission functions shipped <24h ago). Instead, split spray jobs get
-- a payable per-owner path through the existing field-app engine ("Bill via Split
-- Engine" seeds the editor from the job), and two guards prevent double-billing.
--
-- (a) transfer_job_to_invoice: + a JOB_ALREADY_BILLED_VIA_ENGINE guard that refuses to
--     invoice a job which already has a LIVE field-application invoice carrying its
--     job_id. Additive ONLY — byte-identical to live except that one guard (proven via
--     reconstruction md5). No commission / lifecycle logic changed; U8 stays intact.
--     Same signature -> CREATE OR REPLACE preserves grants.
--
-- (b) save_field_app_invoice: + an optional trailing p_job_id (stamps invoices.job_id on
--     created members for provenance) and a seeded-from-job double-bill guard. Adding a
--     parameter changes the signature (CREATE OR REPLACE would leave a second overload),
--     so the old 7-arg overload is DROPped and the 8-arg re-created, then grants are
--     re-applied (authenticated + service_role; PUBLIC/anon revoked — a recreated
--     function otherwise defaults to PUBLIC EXECUTE). A legacy 7-named-arg call resolves
--     to the 8-arg function with p_job_id defaulting NULL, so the pre-deploy frontend
--     keeps working across the deploy window. Body byte-identical to live except the
--     marked inserts (proven via reconstruction md5).
